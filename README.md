Basically an attempt at making a matching game using stage.js , 
and some sound effects. Based it off of some of the examples from the 
stage.js website. Also wanted to add some functionality of the tiles 
dropping to the base, but found found this extremely challenging,
so will perhaps try to implement in the future.

Interesting dealing with the issue of trying to build games in canvas
without using DIVs. Also found that adding a few sound effects makes the 
whole thing alot more interesting, and isn't too hard to do.
